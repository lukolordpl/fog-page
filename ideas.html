						<p class="p-justify-margin-top"><b>Telescoping Spear</b> - Press and hold the Power Button to get ready for the spear throw. Release button to throw a spear. When you hit a survivor, he gets injured and will have spear in his chest, and you will have killer instict on this survivor as long as he has this spear. If you miss, the spear will stay in place where you throw it. You will be able to collect this spear in order to use it again, or wait 30 secound to make this spear automaticly return to you (collecting spear action takes 1.5 second).
						<br><br>
						Survivors can perform taking this spear out of thier chests. They can do it even while running. When they finish this action, spear will stay in the place where survivor finished this action, and they will suffer from deep wound status effect.
						<br><br>
						If you hit injured survivors with the spear, they will be put into dying state. And you will have to wait 30 second for the spear to get back.

					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-8">
						<p class="p-justify-margin-top"><b>Hunting Mode</b> - When ability is ready, press the Active Ability Button to turn on hunting mode for 60 second. During hunting mode you are invisible (like the Wraith) and you do not have terror radius, but you are unable to attack other survivors during this ability and you are moving 20% slower. You still are able to do breaking actions.
						<br><br>
						While ability is active, you can mark survivor with you laser by clicking Ability Button (even from a great distance). After marking a survivor, he will see 3 red dots above his head as an alert. When you mark survivor, your weapon gets ready to fire at him. After 4 second it will fire and if survivor is in a clear sight he is putting into dying state, even if he is full health state. After completing firing action, hunting mode turns off.
						<br><br>
						The survivor during this time has time to hide behind something. If he can hide well, the shot will not hit him. If the survivor hides behind a destructible obstacle (pallet or breakable wall), that obstacle will be destroyed instead of hitting survivor.
